We examine how animating a viewpoint change in a spatial information system affects a user’s ability to build a mental map of the information in the space. We found that animation improves users' ability to reconstruct the information space, with no penalty on task performance time. We believe that this study provides strong evidence for adding animated transitions in many applications with fixed spatial data where the user navigates around the data space.


During the past decade, researchers have explored the use of animation in many aspects of user interfaces. In 1984, the  Apple Macintosh  used rudimentary animation when opening and closing icons. This kind of animation was used to provide a continuous transition from one state of the interface to another, and has become increasingly common, both in research and commercial user interfaces. Users commonly report that they prefer animation, and yet there has been very little research  that attempts to understand how animation affects users’ performance.
